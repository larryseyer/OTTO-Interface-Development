    <p>Open index.html in another tab and test the following:</p>
    
    <h2>Test Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Click on Player 1 tab</li>
        <li>Click the mute drummer button (row 3, area 5 - right side)</li>
        <li>Check: Button should show muted state</li>
        <li>Check: Overlay should appear over rows 3-5</li>
        <li>Check: Player 1 tab should show muted visual</li>
        <li>Switch to Player 2</li>
        <li>Check: Mute button should show unmuted (Player 2's state)</li>
        <li>Check: No overlay should be visible</li>
        <li>Switch back to Player 1</li>
        <li>Check: Mute button should still show muted</li>
        <li>Check: Overlay should be visible again</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Console Commands for Debugging:</h2>
    <pre>
// Check all player mute states
otto.playerStates

// Check current player
otto.currentPlayer

// Check specific player mute state
otto.playerStates[1].muted
otto.playerStates[2].muted

// Manually toggle mute for current player
otto.playerStates[otto.currentPlayer].muted = !otto.playerStates[otto.currentPlayer].muted
otto.updateUIForCurrentPlayer()
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Expected Behaviors:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each player has independent mute state</li>
        <li>Mute state persists when switching players</li>
        <li>Mute state saves with presets</li>
        <li>Visual feedback: button image changes, overlay appears, tab shows muted state</li>
    </ul>
