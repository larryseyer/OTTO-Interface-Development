# OTTO Interface - Template for JUCE 8

## IMPORTANT: This is a UI Template/Prototype Only

**THIS IS NOT A JUCE CLIENT APPLICATION**

This HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation serves as a **visual and behavioral template** that will be used as a reference for building the native OTTO interface in JUCE 8. 

### Purpose
- Provide a working visual prototype of the OTTO interface
- Define the look, feel, and user interactions
- Serve as a behavioral specification for JUCE developers
- Allow testing of UI/UX concepts before native implementation

### What This Is NOT
- This does NOT connect to JUCE
- This does NOT communicate with any audio engine
- This does NOT send/receive messages to/from a backend
- This is NOT the final production interface

The actual OTTO application will be built natively in JUCE 8, using this web interface as a design template and behavioral reference.
